# particle_accelerator_LHC
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the worldâ€™s largest and most powerful particle accelerator. The LHC was designed to discover new, unknown particles that may be produced in the collisions. The data collected in the experiments performed at the LHC can be classified as background events (particles that physicists have already discovered) or signal events (new, unknown particles; usually called new physics particles).

In this project, we look for a simulated new physics signal that is hidden in a large background.
