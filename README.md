# Problem Statement
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the worldâ€™s largest and most powerful particle accelerator. The LHC was designed to discover new, unknown particles that may be produced in the collisions. The data collected in the experiments performed at the LHC can be classified as background events (particles that physicists have already discovered) or signal events (new, unknown particles; usually called new physics particles). In this project, we look for a simulated new physics signal that is hidden in a large background.

Data Description: Each individual datapoint in the dataset contains information about an independent event that has been observed in the detector. More specifically, each event (each row in the dataset) is described by a set of 14 features. The last column indicates if the event corresponds to a signal or a background event.
